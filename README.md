# Genshin News
Genshin News is an automated notification system for Discord. This application scrapes/acquires information from MiHoYo's news website and redestributes the information to users through Discord.

## Motivation
Visiting MiHoYo's website is very tedious and often extremely slow, I spent too much of my time visit their website to acquire information regarding their game. To free up some of my time, I created Genshin News to do the work for me.
